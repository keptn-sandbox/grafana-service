Example of a dashboard automatically generated by the Keptn Grafana Service.

Please note this repository has been created by using the [Keptn Service Template](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-service-template-go). 


The Keptn **Grafana Service** listens for *sh.keptn.event.monitoring.configure* events and automatically generates
- Keptn dashboard with
  - RED metrics for each stage that is defined in the `shipyard` file of Keptn

Trigger the generation by executing e.g., `keptn conifugure monitoring prometheus --project=sockshop --service=carts`

## Installation

The *grafana-service* can be installed as a part of [Keptn's uniform](https://keptn.sh).

### Configure Grafana environment & token

Open the `deploy/service.yaml` file and edit the environment variables accordingly to your environment.
```yaml
env:
  - name: EVENTBROKER 
    value: 'http://event-broker.keptn.svc.cluster.local/keptn' # usually NO edit needed
  - name: CONFIGURATION_SERVICE
    value: 'http://configuration-service.keptn.svc.cluster.local:8080' # usually NO edit needed
  - name: GRAFANA_URL
    value: http://yourgrafana-url # change to your grafana URL
  - name: GRAFANA_TOKEN
    value: yourtoken # add your Grafana token here
  - name: PROMETHEUS_URL
    value: http://yourprometheus-url # add your Prometheus URL here for grafana to fetch the data
```

### Deploy in your Kubernetes cluster

To deploy the current version of the *grafana-service* in your Keptn Kubernetes cluster, apply the [`deploy/service.yaml`](deploy/service.yaml) file:

```console
kubectl apply -f deploy/service.yaml
```

This should install the `grafana-service` together with a Keptn `distributor` into the `keptn` namespace, which you can verify using

```console
kubectl -n keptn get deployment grafana-service -o wide
kubectl -n keptn get pods -l run=grafana-service
```

### Up- or Downgrading

Adapt and use the following command in case you want to up- or downgrade your installed version (specified by the `$VERSION` placeholder):

```console
kubectl -n keptn set image deployment/grafana-service grafana-service=keptnsandbox/grafana-service:$VERSION --record
```

### Uninstall

To delete a deployed *grafana-service*, use the file `deploy/*.yaml` files from this repository and delete the Kubernetes resources:

```console
kubectl delete -f deploy/service.yaml
```


## Deploy Grafana

If you don't have Grafana up-and-running yet, you can use the manifests in the `manifests/` folder that will help you deploying Grafana on your cluster in the `monitoring` namespace.

```
kubectl create namespace monitoring
kubectl apply -f manifests/.
```



## Compatibility Matrix

| Keptn Version    | [grafana-service Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/keptnsandbox/grafana-service/tags) |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
|       0.6.2      | keptnsandbox/grafana-service:0.1.0 |



## Development

Development can be conducted using any GoLang compatible IDE/editor (e.g., Jetbrains GoLand, VSCode with Go plugins).

It is recommended to make use of branches as follows:

* `master` contains the latest potentially unstable version
* `release-*` contains a stable version of the service (e.g., `release-0.1.0` contains version 0.1.0)
* create a new branch for any changes that you are working on, e.g., `feature/my-cool-stuff` or `bug/overflow`
* once ready, create a pull request from that branch back to the `master` branch

When writing code, it is recommended to follow the coding style suggested by the [Golang community](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

You might want to port-forward you configuration service during local development to be able to directly communite with it:
```
kubectl port-forward svc/configuration-service -n keptn 9090:8080
```

Copy the file `env` to `myenv` and add your environment variables to test it locally with:
```console
./local-build.sh && ./local-run.sh
```

If you happen to edit the `keptn.jsonnet` file you might want to give it a try locally first before you run it in the context of the *Grafana Service*. You can do so by executing the following. This will generate a new file in the folder `gen/` called `keptn.json` which contains the generates dashboard template which you can inspect.

```console
jsonnet -J ./grafonnet-lib/ --ext-code stages='["dev","staging"]' --ext-str service=carts --ext-str project=sockshop keptn.jsonnet > gen/keptn.json
```


### Where to start

If you don't care about the details, your first entrypoint is [eventhandlers.go](eventhandlers.go). Within this file  you can add implementation for pre-defined Keptn Cloud events.
 
To better understand Keptn CloudEvents, please look at the [Keptn Spec](https://github.com/keptn/spec).
 
If you want to get more insights, please look into [main.go](main.go), [deploy/service.yaml](deploy/service.yaml),
 consult the [Keptn docs](https://keptn.sh/docs/) as well as existing [Keptn Core](https://github.com/keptn/keptn) and
 [Keptn Contrib](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/) services.
