Thank you for your interest in contributing to Grafonnet! We welcome all people
who want to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our
community. Grafonnet is developed within the Grafana community. Therefore we

## Plugin Scope

**Grafonnet only aims to support core features and plugins.**

While Grafonnet itself only supports core Grafana functionality, we strongly
encourage development and use of community Grafonnet extensions. See the
[Community Plugins](https://grafana.github.io/grafonnet-lib/community-plugins/)
page for more info on this.
